### Hi there 👋, I'm Nihal Mishra. Thanks for checking out my profile!

I’m a computer science graduate student at the University of Florida. Focussed and passionate software engineer with 2 years of professional experience. I started my career with Mercedes Benz Research and Development India where I worked on building Cabin Infotainment and Human Machine Interface (HMI) software for vehicles. Recently I interned with Trader Interactive and helped contribute towards their core backend APIs and developed a standard library from scratch. It enhanced my knowledge of Laravel, Node.js for backend, Vue.js for frontend, AWS CloudWatch, Docker and setting up automated CI/CD pipelines in GitHub. For me, writing maintainable and clean code is a top priority while ensuring scalability. I strive to learn and implement optimized solutions that perform well.
